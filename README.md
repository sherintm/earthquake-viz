The repository contains 2 folders Leaflet-Step-1 and Leaflet-Step-2.<br><br>
Leaflet-Step-1 contains a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the given data set based on their longitude and latitude.<br>
The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and earthquakes with greater depth appears darker in color.<br><br>
Leaflet-Step-2 contains a map using leaflet that plots different styles which can be selected by the user. It also plots a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
